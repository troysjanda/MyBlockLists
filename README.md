# XPI's Custom Annoyance/Yahoo Filter Lists

Custom Filter List for use with Ublock Orgin for Firefox.

XPI's Filter List 
 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/troysjanda/MyBlockLists/master/UBOXPI

Yahoo Complete annoyance blocking list

These filters help to reduce Yahoo tracking, Beacons, Pixel tracking, and ads making Yahoo a more cleaner experience. Note: Some filters can cause blank gaps in articles or sidebar this is unavoidable due in part to the way Yahoo obscures its div, classes in an effort to circumvent blockers.

XPI CNAMEFilterList

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/troysjanda/MyBlockLists/master/CNAMEFilterList.txt

The aim of this filter list is to block websites from using CNAMES to track or serve ads. This list is compiled from the adguard list and will be updated as needed with addition filters from Adguard and other sources. As with my other list if you'd like to add/remove filter please submit a pull request, this will be reviewed and if approved will be added to the filterlist.

Notes:

Users can suggest addition filters be added by creating a issue, or pull request. I will review and approve those addions on a by weekly basis. Users can also report bad, or invalid filter using the same methods. 

Filter request must be only for filters for ads, annoyances, and tracking purposes and submitted filters should not include cosmedic/network filters that hide contect that does not fit those requirements.
