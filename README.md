Custom Filter Lists for use with Ublock Orgin for Firefox.

XPI's Filter List 
 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/troysjanda/MyBlockLists/master/UBOXPI

A collection of personal filters from my daily web activity. These are uncatagorized and may cause breakage. If you find problems, or want to contribute please submit a pull request and ill review and merge.


Yahoo Complete annoyance blocking list

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/troysjanda/MyBlockLists/master/yahoocomplete.txt

These filters help to reduce Yahoo tracking, Beacons, Pixel tracking, and ads making Yahoo a more cleaner experience. Note: Some filters can cause blank gaps in articles or sidebar this is unavoidable due in part to the way Yahoo obscures its div, classes in an effort to circumvent blockers.

Notes:

Users can suggest addition filters be added by creating a issue, or pull request. I will review and approve those addions on a by weekly basis. Users can also report bad, or invalid filter using the same methods. 

Filter request must be only for filters for ads, annoyances, and tracking purposes and submitted filters should not include cosmedic/network filters that hide contect that does not fit those requirements.
